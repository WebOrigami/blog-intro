This project forms the starting point for the [Origami tutorial](https://weborigami.org/language/tutorial.html) that walks you through building a simple blog.

This repository provides just a few files as a head start.

If you'd prefer to create every file by hand to confirm there's no magic involved, make your own project folder and inside that create:

- a `package.json` file like the one here
- some sample blog post files like those in the `markdown` folder
- an empty `src` folder

Then use a currently-maintained version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or later) to install Origami with:

```console
$ npm install
```
