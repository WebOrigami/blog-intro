This project forms the starting point for the [Origami tutorial](https://weborigami.org/language/tutorial.html) that walks you through building a simple blog.

This repository provides just a few files as a head start.

If you'd prefer to create every file by hand to confirm there's no magic involved, create your own project folder with a `package.json` file like the one here, and create some sample blog post files like those in the `markdown` folder.

Either way, you'll want to then

```console
$ npm install
```

to install Origami for this project.
